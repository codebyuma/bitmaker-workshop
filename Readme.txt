  BitMaker Workshop - one-page website
 
  What is it?
  -----------

  A one-page website created at a two-hour BitMaker Labs - Intro to Web Development
  workshop that covered the basics of HTML and CSS. The website was created 
  by following along and copying code during the workshop.

  Website was created with basic CSS for layout and positioning, and includes a tiny 
  bit of responsive design.
